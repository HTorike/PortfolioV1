# Patrick's Portfolio V1

Hello! My name is Patrick, and I'm a front-end software engineer specializing in creating responsive, intuitive, and visually appealing web pages. This portfolio is a space to showcase my latest projects, my skills, and my passion for web development. I hope you enjoy it, and I'd also appreciate any positive or negative feedback you might have. :D

## Page Layout

The page starts with a hero section without a fixed header or any information on it, with only a button at the top to change the theme. The experience was designed for desktop, so the cursor has a "glow effect" to enhance the user's viewing experience.

Following the hero section, there's a "background" area, where I share a bit about who I am.

Next, after the "background" section, we have a section dedicated to showcasing my skills, such as the languages, frameworks, and tools I use in my work.

Finally, there's a section dedicated to my most recent projects.

The page was programmed and designed in English so that everyone, anywhere in the world, can access and understand it without any problems.
