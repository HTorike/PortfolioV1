              I am currently a junior front-end software engineer, capable of creating beautiful pages without sacrificing functionality. I have experience with JavaScript, React, HTML, and CSS, and I am always looking to learn new technologies and improve my skills.

              As a software engineer and designer, I like to make engineering and design align by combining my knowledge and experience in engineering with creativity in drawing. My goal is always to build applications that are scalable and efficient, without sacrificing a good user experience.
